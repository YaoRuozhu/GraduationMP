# Bayesian Networks in Business Processes</h1>

This repository contains all implementation files and experiments conducted for the Extended Dynamic Bayesian Networks introduced in
[1].
  
All code for detecting anomalies [3] and make Predictions [4, 5] in Business Process Logs can be found in this repository.
 
All experiments in the papers can be reproduced using the files in the Anomalies and Predictions directory in the project.

## How To Use
### Anomaly detection
- Load data using the Logfile class
  ```python
    data_object = Logfile(...)
  ```
- Train the EDBN model
  ```python
    model = EDBN.Train.train(data_object)
  ```
- Check for anomalies
  ```python
    EDBN.Anomalies.test(data_object, output_file, model, label_attribute, normal_val)
  ```
  
### Predictive monitoring
- Load data
  ```python
    data_object = Data.get_data("Helpdesk")
  ```
- Select preprocessing settings
  ```python
    settings = Predictions.setting.STANDARD
  ```
- Prepare loaded data with selected settings
  ```python
    data_object.prepare(settings)
  ```
- Get prediction method
  ```python
    m = Methods.get_prediction_method("SDL")
  ```
- Train the model
  ```python
    model = m.train(data_object)
  ```
- Test the model
  ```python
    results = m.test(model, data_object)
  ```
- Get the score obtained by the model
  ```python
    accuracy = Predictions.metric.ACCURACY.calculate(results)
  ```
